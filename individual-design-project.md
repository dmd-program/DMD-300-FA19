# Project 2

## Description

For this project, you will produce a digital design work that critically engages with the project's theme. You will also develop a design concept, production process, and a well-articulated work statement to explains your work to a wide audience. Your work will then be collectively displayed in a class-wide online exhibition.

## Project title and theme

**Project title template:** "_\[ topic \]_ Futures"

Choose a topic that is meaningful to you and apply it to the title template to assemble your project's title. The title is also the general theme of your project. For instance, to create work that engages in discourse of politics, you could create a theme called "Political Futures".

### Theme description

Futures projects are typically optimistic works that engage with important topics \(critical issues\) and examine the opportunities for improvement, change, activism, and betterment of a given situation. Futures projects are often categorized as speculative, discursive, or otherwise as critical design and tend to provide an array of potential outcomes. There are no hard definitions for how futures projects are created, but they often tend to mix fictional elements while maintaining firm grip with contemporary reality—meaning that futures projects often tend to take place or speculate about the future, yet have currency in present day life.

## Project media

If you are unsure of what types of digital projects are available to create, please have a look at the [project categories](/project-categories.md). This is not a comprehensive list, but you should be able to locate your own creative interests within.

## Online Exhibition

Project two will culminate in an online exhibition of student work. Exhibitions typically have a central theme—a conceptual thread that links the work together. Your instructor will coordinate the online exhibition and will be accessible to anyone with Penn State login credentials.

## Rubric

All project deliverables must be met for the project to be graded. A non-submission or non-completion for any part of the project is considered an incomplete project.

1. Met all deliverable requirements: 20%
2. Project outcomes: 
   * Concept: 20%
   * Craft: 20%
   * Work Statement: 20%
   * Participation in online exhibition: 20%
