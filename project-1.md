# Project 1

## Description

In this project, you will work in small team to produce a design process, digital media, and documentation. Your team will build its own project by setting meeting agendas, creating a concept pitch, develop and use a design process/sprint structure, track and document progress using a project blog, and produce project documentation. The project outcomes can take the form of any combination of digital media formats including 2D, 3D, video and motion design, interactive and web, UX/UI app design, and product design. The projects could emphasize a wide range of approaches including tool building, product or service, marketing or awareness campaigns, calls to action, open-source tools, traditional or experimental digital story telling, speculative design, wayfinding, identity systems, toolkits, educational materials, etc.

**The project's concept focus word:** "Nudge"

The word "nudge" in the design sense refers to small adjustments or changes that can have a large impact to behavior or positive outcomes. Your team is encouraged to steer this project in a direction based on your interests.

## Project overview

The project will consist of five phases:

Phase 1: Gather and organize
Phase 2: Develop a design sprint
Phase 3: Pitch
Phase 4: Sprint!
Phase 5: Document

## Team conflict

Though working on a design team as part of a class project can not fully mimic real-world project teams you will encounter or already have encountered, it should suffice for helping you understand the general concepts and ideas. Finding a team that meshes immediately and is good at resolving internal conflict makes for a very productive and gratifying project experience. Unfortunately, when this doesn't happen, team dynamics can be counterproductive. If you run into any issues with your team members that cannot be resolved, please communicate with them with your instructor so they may step in and help mediate the situation.

## Rubric

This project is graded as a team. All members will receive the same grade. All project deliverables must be met for the project to be graded. A non-submission or non-completion for any project phase is considered an incomplete project.

1. Produced and submitted project deliverables according to requirements: 40%
2. Project outcomes: 
   * Concept 20%
   * Craft 20%
   * Design process 20%
