# Writing project

Locate two to five artists, designers, or influential art or design studios that are related to your interests in some way. Locate journal articles, interviews, book chapters, etc., to aid in your research.

**Writing prompts:**

The following are not required 'sections,' rather they are prompts to help you focus your writing and research.

   1. Summarize their work, their legacy and their impact on a particular art or design field.
   2. Can you identify central themes, patterns, or behaviors in their work or habits?
   4. What is the context of their work? Was the work a part of an art or design movement, or influential period in art or design history?
   3. What was their path to get to where they are?  
   4. Distill their ideas and achievements into main points and then relate those points to your own work, interests, learning path, and/or future plans.
