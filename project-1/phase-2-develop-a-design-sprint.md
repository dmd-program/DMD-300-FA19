# Phase 2: Develop a design sprint

You will develop a preliminary design sprint schedule document and [project blog](http://sites.psu.edu).

The document should include:

1. **Cover/title page** 
   * **Title:** Design Sprint Schedule
   * Date
   * Team member names
   * Course name
   * Instructor\(s\)
2. **Schedule:** Consult the [design process and methods page](/design-process-and-methods.md) to choose design and research methods that fit your team's needs and interests. Place the chosen methods onto a schedule. Name the method and describe what occurs in each session with the anticipated outcomes.
   * **Session:** Day, time, duration of session
   * **Method name:** Include one or more methods for each category in the following list. You may repeat categories and methods as often as needed, and they do not all need to be collaborative or group based:
     * Research, discovery
     * Ideation, concept development
     * Production, testing, iteration
     * Analysis, feedback
   * **Description:** Briefly describe how the method works and the anticipated outcomes from using the method. 

The project blog should be hosted using [Sites and Penn State](http://sites.psu.edu). Your team should use this blog to track the progress of the project and to show interesting project outcomes.

* If any project team members are concerned about privacy, project members may use a pseudonym \(pen name\) and in addition, the blog is able to be password protected to Penn State WebAccess users. Please contact your instructor if this is a concern and need help with blog configuration.

## Submission details:

1. Publish a link to the project blog, even if currently blank, on the related Canvas discussion.
2. Upload a .zip file to the canvas assignment that includes:
   * Link to the blog in the assignment submission
   * Design Sprint Schedule document in PDF format.
